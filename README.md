##Assignment brief

Course Assignment – Group project
Brief
To create a web development agency website. The website should have a coherent design with a home page, and each team member should have a bio page about them listing things like their experience, skills, and projects. You can add other functionalities and pages to the website but at minimum it should have 

Team members can be assigned specific roles and responsibilities for example designing the prototype, but all team members must complete one story per sprint. And each team member should commit to the project for their bio page.

Level 1 Process
    1. Set up a meeting with your team.
    2. Assign a scrum master to manage sprints. For more info on being a scrum master you can read this article. We recommend two sprints split over the 4 weeks of Industry Knowledge.
    3. Create a product backlog with stories that are assigned to members of the team. Each team member should complete at least one story within the sprint. A story is the smallest unit of work in agile and is commonly formulated like so “as a _user type_ I want to _do something_ so that I can _get something_”. 
    4. Hold daily standup meetings to discuss the product backlog and ensure the team is on track to deliver what was planned for that sprint.
    5. At the end of the sprint, review what was achieved and plan for the next sprint.
    6. Deliver the website with a report per student reflecting on the process.
Delivery
Each student should deliver a link to the finished portfolio website, your groups’ repository and a report reflecting on the process and outlining what you worked on for the website, what went well, what didn’t, and what you’d do differently next time.
